Hi, I'm Kars van den Toorn and welcome to my portfolio page! I am 18 years old and I am a student at Saxion, studying CMGT. There I have taken the role of engineer, with artist as secondary role. Below you can see various projects I have worked on.

### Cat Media and Gourmet Technologies
<img src="../Assets/CMGT/CMGTScreenshot.png" width="500" />\
This game was made for the 2nd group project, project New Horizons, and it is the project I am the happiest with, as I had fun working on it and it's the most complete as a game. I mainly worked on the algorithm for generating the matching grid, connecting systems together and implementing assets and code for the customers and score.

### Dining Dungeons
Can be divided into the generation algorithm, the shaders used in it and the architecture of the gameplay scripts. Project not completely finished yet. 

**Dungeon generation:** The dungeons you pass through are generated procedurally by an algorithm I made to generate the rooms, their assets and the objects inside them. 

**Shaders:** The project contains various selfmade shaders, like the cellshade one that's on most of the objects in the game, the wave and splat effects, the shader to stretch objects based on their velocity and the projectile chart line (it's a quad with a line rendered onto it by shader).

**Architecture:** the gameplay scripts are made to be modular and easily reusable, enemies are easily modifiable as their attack patterns can be set by dragging in a different pattern, their pathfinding is separate from the enemy itself and can also be easily modified.

### The Devils Gambit
This game was made for the 3rd project, project Kickstart, for it I mainly worked on the player controller and animation implementation, UI elements and some of the card effects (both me and the other engineer worked on those) and card visual when placing.

### Rise and Fall
This game was made for a gamejam, with a time-limit of 48 hours. For it I worked on the gameplay elements, like the player controller and being able to forward/rewind time, I also implemented animations for the player character, which I hadn't worked with before so I had to learn how to work with them. Later in the Devils Gambit project I also implemented animations, but in a better way as I had more experience with it by then, and I had more time to make it good.

### Planet generation
This project I made alone, I worked on terrain generation to procedurally generate planets using 3D noise. I also textured the planets generated using a shader, using the steepness of the terrain for the texture. To make this I had to research principles of terrain generation and how to refine noise into being usable.
