Hi, I'm Kars van den Toorn and welcome to my portfolio page! I am a student at Saxion, studying CMGT. There I have taken the role of engineer, with artist as secondary role. Below you can see various projects I have worked on. 

## Dining Dungeons
<img src="../Assets/DiDu/DiDuScreenshot.png" width="750" />\
This is an individual project I made on my own, it is quite a large project and as a result, I learned a lot from this one:

**Dungeon generation:** The dungeons you pass through are generated procedurally by an algorithm I made to generate the rooms, their assets and the objects inside them.\
**Shaders:** The project contains various selfmade shaders, like the cell-shade one that's on most of the objects in the game, the wave and splat effects, the shader to stretch objects based on their velocity and the projectile chart line (it's a quad with a line rendered onto it by shader).\
**Architecture:** the gameplay scripts are made to be modular and easily reusable, enemies are easily modifiable as their attack patterns can be set by dragging in a different pattern, their pathfinding is separate from the enemy itself and can also be easily modified.  

Things I learned:
- Applying design patterns to make code easily reusable and modifiable.
- Using event-based architecture to decouple code.
- How to work with algorithms like BFS, DFS, flood-fill and marching squares.
- Advanced debugging techniques to properly debug an algorithm.
- Creating and modifying textures using C#, HLSL and ShaderGraph. 
- Applying 3D math for both visual effects and gameplay.

## Cat Media and Gourmet Technologies
<img src="../Assets/CMGT/CMGTScreenshot.png" width="750" />\
This game was made as part of a group project, and it is the project I am the happiest with, as I had fun working on it together with the rest of the team and it's the most complete as a game. I mainly worked on the algorithm for generating the matching grid, connecting systems together and implementing assets and code for the customers and score. 

Things I learned:
- Creating an algorithm for grid-based generation. 
- Defining the rules an algorithm should work with.
- Translating the rules an algorithm should work with into code. 
- Gained more experience in group-based working.

## Planet generation
<img src="../Assets/PG/PG2Planets.png" width="750" />\
For this project I worked on terrain generation, to procedurally generate planets using 3D noise. I also textured the planets generated using a shader, using the steepness of the terrain for the texture and added 2D noise to give the texture more variety. To make this I had to research principles of terrain generation and how to refine noise into being usable. 

Things I learned:
- Generating meshes in code.
- Creating and refining 2D and 3D noises.
- Turning noise into terrain.
- Procedurally texturing generated meshes.

## The Devils Gambit
<img src="../Assets/TDG/TDGPlatforming.png" width="750" />\
This game was made as part of a group project where the goal was to make a vertical slice of a game as prototype. For it I mainly worked on the player controller and animation implementation, UI elements and some of the card effects (both me and the other engineer worked on those) and card visual when placing. 

Things I learned:
- Implementation of 2D animations.
- Making a proper player controller
- Making an animation controller for player animations. 
- Making an easily modifiable tileset. 
- Gained more experience in group-based working.

## Rise and Fall
<img src="../Assets/RAF/RAFGameplay.png" width="750" />\
This game was made for a gamejam, with a time-limit of 48 hours. For it I worked on the gameplay elements, like the player controller and being able to forward/rewind time, I also implemented 3D animations for the player character, which I hadn't worked with before so I had to learn how to work with them. 

Things I learned:
- Troubleshooting issues with a rig. 
- 3D animation implementation.
