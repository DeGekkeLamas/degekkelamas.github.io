This game was made as part of a group project where the goal was to make a vertical slice of a game as prototype. For it I mainly worked on the player controller and animation implementation, UI elements and some of the card effects (both me and the other engineer worked on those) and card visual when placing. 

Things I learned:
- Implementation of 2D animations.
- Making an animation controller for player animations. 
- Making an easily modifiable tileset. 
- Gained more experience in group-based working.
